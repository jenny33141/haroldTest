            The Straw Hat Pirates, also Known as the Mugiwara Prirates are an infamous and incredibly powerfull rising
            pirate group that originated from the East Blue, but have various members from different areas. They are 
            the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime. The <q>Straw Hats</q> are led by the main protagonist

                Monkey D. Luffy may be young and dimwitted at times, but he is also very lovable, and he happens to be one of 
                One Piece's best fighters. In order to be a captain you need to be strong, but what makes luffy a true leader is 
                that he will do anything to help people in need, especially his friends.
                <br>
                Luffy decided to become a pirate at age 7 after meeting Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates, he later then made a 
                pact with his foster brothers, Ace and Sabo to set sail when they turn 17. Luffy was the last one to leave their 
                island home, and when he got into his little boat, he immediately started looking for 10 crewmates.

                <p>
                Every pirate crew needs a first mate, and for the Straw Hats thats's Zoro, a bounty hunter who dreams of becoming the 
                worlds greatest swordsman. When Luffy met Zoro, the swordsman was tied to a pole where he was serving a 30 day
                sentence for killing a wolf that belonged to the son of a corrupt Marine captain. The wolf was attacking a little 
                girl at the time and Zoro agreed to be tied up to gain amnesty.
                <br>
                As a bounty hunter, Zoro rejected Luffy's initial invitation to join his crew but that changed when he learnt that 
                Luffy attacked the captains son who planned on executing Zoro instead of freeing him.

                <p>
                Nami was the crews third official member, and the Straw Hat Navigator first met Luffy and Zoro while she was stealing a 
                treasure map from Buggy the clown. During this arc, Luffy saves Nami from Buggy, an act which leads to her joining the 
                crew. 
                <br>
                Later during the Arlong Park Arc, Nami Betrays the Straw Hats by revealing that she was part of Arlongs Crew all along 
                but later we find out that she was forced to join the crew to save herself and her village. Once Arlong betrays her, 
                Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Usopp decide to save her and the village themselves, thus solidifying her allegiance to the 
                Straw hats.

                <p>
                Usopp is pretty cowardly at times, but when push comes to shove he can hold his own against certain enemies.
                The young Straw Hat crew met Usopp in Syrup village, and they helped him to defend his friend/love interest 
                Kaya from Kuro, a pirate who was plootting to kill her and steal her inheritence.
                <br>
                After Luffy and Zoro saved Usopp and Kaya from certain death, he decided to help them fight Kuro's crew, and 
                this battle caused Usopp to find the courage he needed to set sail and become a pirate like his father. When 
                Luffy invited him to join his crew, he provided the Straw hats with their <q>Jolly Roger</q>, the crews first 
                ship

                <p>
                    Before it was revealed that Sanji was a member of the infamous Vinsmoke family, One Piece fans knew him as 
                    "Black Leg" Sanji-the former sous chef of the seafaring Baratie restaurant. This is where the Straw Hats 
                    met their future cook. 
                    <br>
                    Sanji ended up joining the crew after Luffy helped defend the restaurant from Don Krieg, an infamous 
                    East Blue pirate. When Luffy fell into the ocean after the fight, Sanji jumped in to save him. 
                    The other Baratie chefs later convinced Sanji to join the Straw Hats so he could fulfill his dream 
                    of finding the All Blue, a part of the ocean that contains every fish a chef would ever want.

                <p>
                    Chopper is the crew's doctor, and he dreams of one day becoming a doctor who can cure any disease. 
                    He also happens to be a reindeer who ate a devil fruit that turned him into a human hybrid. 
                    <br>
                    The crew met Chopper on Drum Island, and when Nami invited him to join them he refused due to his 
                    mistrust of humans. Luffy defeats Wapol-the former king of the island who killed Chopper's mentor 
                    and desecrated his memory. Chopper declines to join the crew yet again, but he changed his mind 
                    after remembering how his mentor wanted him to set sail to see the world in order to broaden his 
                    medical knowledge.

                <p>
                    As a child, Robin witnessed the destruction of her home at the hands of the World Government, and 
                    she has been on the run ever since. The Straw Hats met Robin during the Alabasta Arc, where she was 
                    originally an antagonist as she initially served as the second in command of Crocodile's criminal 
                    organization, Baroque Works. 
                    <br>
                    Crocodile eventually betrays Robin and leaves her for dead, but Luffy ends up saving her life, 
                    which is why she appears on the Straw Hats' ship at the end of the arc and asks to join them. 
                    Luffy agreed, thus making her the crew's archaeologist.

                <p>
                    Franky was the eighth person to join the Straw Hats, and this happened during the Water 7 Arc. 
                    This cyborg is the crew's shipwright, and he actually started off as "villain" who stole all 
                    of the Straw Hats' gold. 
                    <br>
                    Franky ends up getting kidnapped by CP9 - one of the World Government's covert factions - and 
                    when the Straw Hats follow CP9 to Ennies Lobby to rescue Robin, Franky escapes and agrees to 
                    help them. Once everyone is safe, Franky reveals that he used the crew's money to buy the wood 
                    from the Adam tree (the strongest kind of wood in the One Piece world), which he used to build 
                    the Thousand Sunny, the Straw Hats' new ship. He joined them in order to sail around the world 
                    on a ship made from this wood.

                    Luffy wanted a musician for a long time, and he finally got his wish when the crew met Brook during 
                    the Thriller Bark Arc. When Brooke was alive, he ate a devil fruit which amplified his soul to the 
                    point that he could resurrect himself but by the time he found his body, just a skeleton remained.
                    <br>
                    Every member of the crew was terrified of Brook at first, except for Luffy who invited him to join 
                    the crew immediately, but he declined because he could not venture out in sunlight thanks to his shadow 
                    being stolen. Luffy and the crew succeeded in retrieving his shadow, but he did not join the crew until 
                    he learned that an old friend who was waiting for him to return was still alive.

                    Jinbe was the captain of the Sun pirates and a former Warlord, and he befriended Luffy while they were both in the 
                    underwater prison known as Impel Down. Luffy was there to save his brother Ace, and the two escaped with other 
                    inmates to go to Marineford to stop Ace's execution.
                    <br>
                    During the Summit War, Jinbe renounced his Warlord title and joined The Whitebeard Pirates, but when Whitebeard died 
                    he aligned himself with Big Mom, who agreed to protect Fish-man Island. After the Straw Hats stopped an attempted coup 
                    on the island, Luffy invited him to join the crew, and Jinbe agreed to join after severing ties with Big Mom, which 
                    happened after the Whole Cake Island Arc.
